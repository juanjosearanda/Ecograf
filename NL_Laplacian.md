https://github.com/juanjosearanda/Ecograf/blob/main/Papers/Modificaci%C3%B3n%20al%20Laplaciano%20No%20Lineal.pdf 

The authors of the source article present a modification to the nonlinear Laplacian (LNL) algorithm for enhancing edges in images [1]. They argue that while the LNL algorithm is effective in edge enhancement, it requires preliminary filtering, which can be computationally expensive [2]. Additionally, the LNL algorithm tends to emphasize noise in the image [2].

Proposed Modification
The proposed modification aims to address these limitations. The process involves:

Initial Edge Detection: The Roberts Gradient is applied to the image to identify potential edges [2].
Thresholding: The gradient values are compared to a threshold derived from the peaks in the image histogram. Only pixels with gradient values exceeding the threshold are considered for further processing [2].
Selective Application of LNL: The LNL algorithm is applied only to those pixels identified as potential edge pixels in the previous steps [2].
Benefits of the Modification
The authors argue that this modification offers several advantages:

Improved Edge Enhancement: The modification results in better edge enhancement compared to both the original LNL and the Roberts Gradient alone [3].
Noise Reduction: By selectively applying the LNL algorithm, the modification effectively reduces noise amplification [3].
Efficiency: The elimination of the preliminary filtering step reduces computational complexity [2]. The execution time remains comparable to the Roberts Gradient, which is known for its speed [3].

Conclusion
The authors conclude that their modification to the LNL algorithm offers a more efficient and effective method for edge enhancement in images, particularly for ECG images where accurate edge detection is crucial for further analysis [3].
